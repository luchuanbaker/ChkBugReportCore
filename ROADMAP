ROADMAP
=======

v0.5 - Cleanup and unification: use the same style of tables and charts. All tables and charts
    should behave the same (i.e. all charts should have interactive version, all tables should
    save to database, etc).
    Cleanup information storage as well (easy to use, generic, flexible)
    Cleanup plugin&extension architecture (add more hooks? add annotations for auto-hooking?)

     - GUI and usability improvements. Files should be automatically detected (so no need to -sl
    option for example, but still possible). User can drag'n'drop files in the window to 'build'
    the dummy bugreport and execute the processing.

v0.? - Server support. Run internal webserver. This will give us AJAX support and more interactivitity.

v0.? - Look into data mining theory and AI and try to build a more powerful knowledge base.
    The idea is that plugins would just produce a lot of information snippets, and some AI would
    then detect the problems based on the info.
